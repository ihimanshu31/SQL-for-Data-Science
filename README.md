## Welcome to the SQL for Data Science course from the University of California Davis!

This course is designed for learners who have no previous SQL coding experience and 
want to learn why and how to use SQL to shape data for targeted analyses. They will start
out by distinguishing between using SQL for data science applications and SQL for more
common data management operations. The course will walk you through the steps so you 
can confidently develop and test SQL queries. You will develop the skills to use advance
filters to sort and prepare a data subset prepared from a larger subset. This course 
culminates in a hands-on project where you will apply your SQL coding skills to create
an analytics-ready dataset that will be used to predict which types of customers will 
accept credit card promotions.

To begin, I recommend taking a few minutes to explore the course site, review the material
we’ll cover each week, and preview the suggested assignments you’ll need to complete to get
the most out of this learning experience. If you have questions about course content, 
please post them in the forums to get help from others in the course community. For 
technical problems with the Coursera platform, visit the Learner Help Center.

### WHAT YOU WILL LEARN IN THIS COURSE:
  --Identify a subset of data needed from a column or set of columns and write a SQL query 
    to limit to those results.
  
  -- Use SQL commands to filter, sort, and summarize data.
  
  -- Create an analysis table from multiple queries using the UNION operator.
  
  -- Manipulate strings, dates, & numeric data using functions to integrate data from different 
    sources into fields with the correct format for analysis.
